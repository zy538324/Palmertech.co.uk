    <h2>Terms & Conditions</h2>
    <div class="terms-list">
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Introduction & Applicability</strong><br>
                These Terms and Conditions (“Terms”) apply to all clients (“Clients”) of Palmertech’s services, including access to our website and any web or mobile development services provided. By using our website or commissioning work, you agree to be bound by these Terms.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Scope of Services</strong><br>
                Palmertech provides bespoke web and mobile development services in accordance with agreed project proposals. Any additional features or variations must be requested and confirmed in writing, and may incur extra charges. This ensures clarity and prevents scope creep.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Client Obligations & Timelines</strong><br>
                Clients must provide required materials, approvals, and feedback promptly. Palmertech is not liable for delays or missed deadlines caused by late responses, incomplete information, or withheld resources from the Client.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Pricing & Payment</strong><br>
                Project pricing, deposit amounts, and invoicing schedules will be agreed within the project proposal.<br>
                Deposits are non-refundable.<br>
                Full payment is required before transferring any intellectual property rights.<br>
                Late payments may result in interest charges and/or suspension of services.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Intellectual Property (IP)</strong><br>
                Until full payment is received, all code, designs, and documentation remain the property of Palmertech.<br>
                Upon full payment, intellectual property rights are assigned to the Client, enabling unrestricted long-term use.<br>
                Palmertech reserves the right to re-use code libraries, frameworks, or techniques developed independently and not specific to a Client’s project.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Maintenance & Support</strong><br>
                Palmertech includes 30 days of post-launch bug fixing as standard.<br>
                Ongoing support, maintenance, or feature enhancements beyond this period are subject to a separate agreement and billing.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Third-Party Tools & Licensing</strong><br>
                Palmertech may use third-party tools, APIs, plugins, or licensed content. While we endeavour to select reliable providers, Palmertech is not responsible for failures, price changes, or discontinuation of third-party services.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Portfolio & Marketing Rights</strong><br>
                Palmertech reserves the right to showcase completed projects in its portfolio, marketing materials, and case studies unless the Client specifically requests otherwise in writing.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Client Content Responsibility</strong><br>
                Clients are responsible for ensuring all text, images, and materials provided are accurate, lawful, and do not infringe third-party rights. Palmertech accepts no liability for legal issues arising from Client-supplied content.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Testing & Compatibility</strong><br>
                Palmertech will test deliverables against commonly used modern browsers and devices as defined in the project proposal. Compatibility outside of this agreed scope is not guaranteed and may require additional charges.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Limitation of Liability</strong><br>
                Palmertech’s liability for any direct damages is capped at the total amount paid by the Client for the specific project.<br>
                Palmertech is not liable for indirect, incidental, or consequential damages such as lost profits, business interruption, or data loss.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Disclaimers & Warranties</strong><br>
                All services are provided “as-is,” without warranties of uninterrupted or error-free operation.<br>
                Palmertech takes reasonable measures to deliver high-quality work but cannot guarantee absolute bug-free performance.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Force Majeure</strong><br>
                Palmertech will not be held liable for delays or failure to deliver services caused by circumstances beyond our reasonable control, including but not limited to natural disasters, server outages, strikes, pandemics, or supplier failures.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Confidentiality & Data Protection</strong><br>
                Both Palmertech and the Client agree to treat all confidential information received from the other party with strict confidentiality. Palmertech operates in compliance with the UK GDPR and Data Protection Act 2018 when handling personal data.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Termination & Suspension</strong><br>
                Palmertech may suspend or terminate services if the Client breaches these Terms, fails to make payments, or otherwise undermines the viability of the project.<br>
                If a Client cancels a project before completion, deposits are non-refundable and staged payments remain due for all work completed up to that point.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Acceptance & Handover</strong><br>
                Deliverables will be presented to the Client for review and acceptance.<br>
                Once accepted (explicitly or by continued use), Palmertech is no longer responsible for future changes unless covered by a maintenance agreement.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Modifications & Interruptions</strong><br>
                Palmertech may modify services, features, or website content when necessary. While every effort is made to minimise disruption, uninterrupted access cannot be guaranteed.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Privacy & External Links</strong><br>
                Use of Palmertech services is subject to our Privacy Policy, which details GDPR compliance and data handling. Palmertech is not responsible for the content or practices of external websites linked to or from our platform.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Amendments</strong><br>
                These Terms may be updated periodically. Clients will be notified of material changes. Continued use of services constitutes acceptance of updated Terms.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Governing Law & Jurisdiction</strong><br>
                These Terms are governed by the laws of England and Wales. Any disputes arising from these Terms shall be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of England and Wales.
            </li>
